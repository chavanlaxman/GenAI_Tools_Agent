MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol that defines how AI models (like ChatGPT or other LLMs) interact with external tools, databases, APIs, and systems in a secure and structured way.

Purpose:
It allows AI systems to connect safely to live data or perform actions using tools without hardcoding integrations.

Example:

ChatGPT uses MCP to talk to tools like:

Web search

Python environment

Document editors (canmore)

Memory (bio)

This ensures structured, traceable, and secure communication between the model and connected tools.

Think of it as:
👉 “A standard way for AI to plug into external systems.
