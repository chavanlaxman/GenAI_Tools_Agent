TestRigor: A Comprehensive Framework for Automated Software Testing
how it works: give your test description, and it generates test cases, executes them, and reports results.
https://app.testrigor.com/test-suites/wGcnyuhkfessL7P9x/test-cases
TestRigor is an advanced automated software testing framework designed to streamline the testing process. By simply providing a description of the test you want to perform,
 TestRigor generates relevant test cases, executes them, and compiles detailed reports on the results.

 TestRigor is an AI-powered test automation tool that allows QA engineers to create and run tests using plain English commands instead of traditional code.
It focuses on codeless automation using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI to reduce maintenance and speed up test creation.

| Capability                            | Description                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🗣️ **NLP-based Test Creation**       | Allows test creation using plain English (e.g., *“click on login button”*, *“enter email as ‘[test@gmail.com](mailto:test@gmail.com)’”*). |
| 🤖 **Self-Healing Tests**             | Automatically adapts to UI changes (like changed element locators or attributes).                                                         |
| 🧩 **Generative AI Test Suggestions** | Suggests and generates test cases from user stories, requirements, or manual test cases.                                                  |
| 🧠 **Contextual Understanding**       | Understands user intent (not just element names), improving reliability of automation.                                                    |
| 🔁 **Cross-Platform Support**         | Automates **Web**, **Mobile**, and **API** testing in the same framework.                                                                 |
| 🔍 **Smart Test Maintenance**         | AI identifies flaky tests or redundant steps and suggests fixes.                                                                          |
| 📊 **Test Analytics & Reporting**     | Generates intelligent insights about test runs, failures, and coverage.                                                                   |



| Testing Layer                | How TestRigor Helps                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **UI / End-to-End Testing**  | Automates full user workflows across browser and mobile.                  |
| **Functional Testing**       | Validates app features using human-like actions and NLP test steps.       |
| **API Testing**              | Supports REST/SOAP calls and validations directly within same test suite. |
| **Regression Testing**       | Self-healing tests reduce maintenance during frequent UI changes.         |
| **Acceptance Testing (UAT)** | Business teams can write executable test cases in plain English.          |
